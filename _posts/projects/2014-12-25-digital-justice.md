## Digital Justice: Public Discourse, Censorship, and the Technologies of Dissent

Responding to President Bollinger's call to expand the campus conversation
about Equal Justice, this proposal, *Digital Justice*, harnesses the emerging
field of "Digital Humanities" towards critically engaging with questions of
digital publics, free speech, censorship and technologies of dissent. We
propose three rounds of workshops at the Global Centers in Mumbai, Amman and
Santiago where local NGOs, artists, and academics can think through the
implication of these global concerns in their specific geographies. These
conversations will lead to a series of publications, lectures, tools, and other
digital artifacts that seek to affect change for digital justice globally. We
will conclude with a symposium at Columbia in the last year of the Project to
summarize and present the research to Columbia community at Morningside and to
think about the long-term impact. We aim to work with the Global Center
Directors in shaping the individual programs and to involve a diverse array of
faculty across the three years of the project.

##Santiago: Technologies of Resistance
Over two days, we will be hosting a series of workshops, lectures and town-hall style discussions at [Columbia's Global Center in Santiago](http://globalcenters.columbia.edu/santiago/). These sessions will include the participation of various academics, artists, journalists, developers, hackers, non-governmental organisations, and more. Considering the unique history of dissent  in Chile, we hope to discuss the specific ways mechanisms of resistance can be and have been preserved and extended into the digital age.
